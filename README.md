**🎬 Narrative Frames: Text-to-Video Storytelling**

Welcome to **Narrative Frames**, a Streamlit‑powered application that transforms your written narrative into a dynamic, animated video. Harnessing the power of AnimateDiff, MotionAdapter, and advanced audio pipelines, you can turn any text prompt into a polished video story in minutes.

## 🔎 Features

* **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and extract core story segments using `preprocessing.py` (pronoun stripping, NP extraction).
* **Diffusion‑based Video Generation**: Load and run the ByteDance AnimateDiff‑Lightning pipeline to generate per‑segment video clips.
* **Audio Synthesis**: Generate narration audio with Coqui TTS and synchronize it with video frames.
* **Streamlit UI**: Intuitive web interface (`streamlit_app.py`) to upload scripts, preview segments, and download final MP4.
* **Automatic Deployment**: Built‑in support for ngrok tunnels to share your local app publicly.
